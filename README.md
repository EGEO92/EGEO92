## About Me:
I am an engineer with over 15 years of experience as a lifeguard, which has taught me the importance of teamwork and quick decision-making under pressure. I have worked 2 years in fiber optic and coaxial networks and IT, where I have been able to apply my analytical skills and attention to detail.

My true passion for technology has led me to explore web development, and I am committed to specializing in Node.js, JavaScript, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, and Express.js. I am excited about the opportunity to combine my technical skills with my previous experience to solve problems in innovative ways.
